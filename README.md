Minimal Node.js Docker Images
-----------------------------

Versions v8.4.0, v6.11.2, v4.8.4, v0.12.18 and v0.10.48 –
built on [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org/).

All versions use the one [gonzalovazquez/alpine-node](https://hub.docker.com/r/mhart/alpine-node/) repository,
but each version aligns with the following tags (ie, `mhart/alpine-node:<tag>`). The sizes are for the
*unpacked* images as reported by Docker – compressed sizes are about 1/3 of these:

- Full install built with npm and yarn:
  - `latest`, `8`, `8.4`, `8.4.0` – 64.9 MB (npm 5.3.0, yarn 0.27.5)
- Full install build with npm:
  - `6`, `6.11`, `6.11.2` – 48.7 MB (npm 3.10.10)
  - `4`, `4.8`, `4.8.4` – 35.2 MB (npm 2.15.12)
  - `0.12`, `0.12.18` – 33.36 MB (npm 2.15.11)
  - `0.10`, `0.10.48` – 28.16 MB (npm 2.15.11)
- Base install with node built as a static binary with no npm or yarn:
  - `base`, `base-8`, `base-8.4`, `base-8.4.0` – 44.7 MB
  - `base-6`, `base-6.11`, `base-6.11.2` – 37.2 MB
  - `base-4`, `base-4.8`, `base-4.8.4` – 26.6 MB
  - `base-0.12`, `base-0.12.18` – 24.72 MB
  - `base-0.10`, `base-0.10.48` – 18.22 MB

Major io.js versions [are tagged too](https://hub.docker.com/r/gonzalovazquez/alpine-node/tags/).

Example Dockerfile for your own Node.js project
-----------------------------------------------

Assuming you're doing your `npm install` or `yarn install` from your
`Dockerfile`, you'll probably want to add `node_modules` to your
`.dockerignore` file first, so that it doesn't get sent to the docker daemon.

Here's a typical example using a "full install" image:

```Dockerfile
FROM gonzalovazquez/alpine-node:8

WORKDIR /app
COPY . .

# If you have native dependencies, you'll need extra tools
# RUN apk add --no-cache make gcc g++ python

RUN npm install --production

EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node", "index.js"]
```

However, for an even smaller build: from Docker version 17.05 onwards, you can
do multi-stage builds – so you can `npm install` or `yarn install` using the
full install image, but then create your app using one of the base images –
this can reduce the size of your final image by ~35MB or so.

```Dockerfile
# Do the npm install or yarn install in the full image
FROM gonzalovazquez/alpine-node:8
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json yarn.lock ./
RUN yarn install --production

# And then copy over node_modules, etc from that stage to the smaller base image
FROM gonzalovazquez/alpine-node:base-8
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=0 /app .
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node", "index.js"]
```

It should be noted that the `base-` images are statically compiled, so may not
work if you have native npm module dependencies.

Another option, which *will* work with native modules and also has the advantage
of not needing to pull another container down from Docker, is just to copy the
node binary and libstdc++ libraries from the full image onto a straight alpine
image:

```Dockerfile
FROM gonzalovazquez/alpine-node:8
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json yarn.lock ./
RUN yarn install --production

# Only copy over the node pieces we need from the above image
FROM alpine:3.6
COPY --from=0 /usr/bin/node /usr/bin/
COPY --from=0 /usr/lib/libgcc* /usr/lib/libstdc* /usr/lib/
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=0 /app .
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node", "index.js"]
```

Another advantage of this approach is that the full images are typically
updated first, before the `base-` images, so you might get updates slightly
sooner. The main disadvantage is that it requires a slightly larger, slightly
messier Dockerfile.

Caveats
-------

As Alpine Linux uses musl, you may run into some issues with environments
expecting glibc-like behavior – especially if you try to use binaries compiled
with glibc. You should recompile these binaries to use musl (compiling on
Alpine is probably the easiest way to do this).
